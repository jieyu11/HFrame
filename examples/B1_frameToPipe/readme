# the example uses the averaged T frame (produced by: A1_rooToFrames) to fit the peaks at the 
# cross section of the cooling pipes to obtain the whole cooling pipe temperature.
# it assumes you have the input files under: 
# --> roo/combined/longFlawRevNo4_sL_80lens_m55.root
# make sure you write the name of the folder under roo/ correctly into input.txt
#
# running:
source run.sh

# results under roo/Pipes/.
